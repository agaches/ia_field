# Phase 1: Strategy - Individual AI Strategy

## Why strategic AI planning matters

Strategic AI planning helps you identify the right tools for your work, avoid wasted time and money, and ensure responsible usage. A clear strategy prevents tool overload and keeps you focused on productivity gains.

## Identify AI use cases

Identify tasks where AI improves your productivity:

**Common use cases by role**:
- **Writing**: Emails, documentation, content creation, editing
- **Development**: Code completion, debugging, documentation, test generation
- **Analysis**: Data interpretation, research synthesis, pattern identification
- **Creative**: Image generation, mockups, brainstorming, design ideas

**Selection criteria**:
1. Repetitive and time-consuming tasks
2. Tasks requiring quick iteration (drafts, prototypes)
3. Tasks where AI augments your expertise (not replaces it)

## Define an AI technology strategy

### AI services (SaaS)

Use SaaS solutions exclusively. No infrastructure setup, no local models, no complex APIs.

**Tool matrix by category**:

| Category | Example Tools | Usage | Cost |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|------|
| **Conversational AI** | ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini | Writing, brainstorming, analysis | 0-20€/month |
| **Code Assistance** | GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor | Code completion, generation | 10-20€/month |
| **Media Generation** | Midjourney, DALL-E | Images, mockups | 10-20€/month |
| **Productivity** | Notion AI, Grammarly | Documents, correction | 10-30€/month |

**Selection approach**:
1. Choose 2-3 tools aligned with your use cases
2. Typical budget: 20-50€/month
3. Start with free tiers, upgrade if needed

## Define a data strategy

### Data classification rules

**✅ Safe to share**:
- Personal notes and drafts (non-confidential)
- Open-source code and public documentation
- Public information and general knowledge questions

**❌ Never share**:
- Customer data, credentials, API keys
- Confidential intellectual property
- Proprietary code and business secrets
- Personally identifiable information (PII)

**⚠️ Check company policy**:
- Internal documents and project information
- Company code (even if non-confidential)
- Business data and metrics

**Paid tools with security review may allow some company data** - always verify with IT first.

## Develop a responsible AI strategy

### Your responsibilities

- **Validate outputs**: Never trust AI blindly, always verify facts and code
- **Respect data rules**: Follow classification guidelines above
- **Acknowledge limitations**: AI has biases, can hallucinate, makes mistakes
- **Be transparent**: Mention AI usage for code reviews, published content
- **Own your results**: You're responsible for what you share and produce

### Ethical considerations

- Check for bias in AI outputs (gender, culture, confirmation bias)
- Verify sources and references (AI can invent citations)
- Test code before using it in production
- Vary prompts and tools for critical decisions

## Example AI strategy

**Developer example**:
- **Use cases**: Code completion, debugging, documentation, learning new frameworks
- **Tools**: GitHub Copilot ($10) + Claude Pro ($20)
- **Data**: Open-source code only, no proprietary code
- **Budget**: $30/month
- **ROI target**: Save 3+ hours/week

**Non-technical example**:
- **Use cases**: Email drafting, content creation, research, document editing
- **Tools**: ChatGPT Plus ($20) + Grammarly free
- **Data**: Public information, personal drafts only
- **Budget**: $20/month
- **ROI target**: Save 2+ hours/week

## Strategy Checklist
