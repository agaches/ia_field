# Employee AI Framework

> Individual AI adoption to improve your personal productivity

## Purpose

This framework is for **individuals** (technical and non-technical) who want to start using AI for their productivity:
- Developers (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.)
- Office workers (ChatGPT, Claude, M365 Copilot)
- Creative professionals (writing, research, analysis)

**Target audience**: Anyone looking to improve personal productivity with AI tools

**Maturity level**: Levels 1-2 (basic to intermediate) - See [SKILLS.md](../SKILLS.md)

## Prerequisites

**None** - This is the entry point for AI adoption.

Start here if:
- You've never used AI tools
- You want to explore AI for personal productivity
- Your team has no AI experience yet

## 6-Phase Framework
