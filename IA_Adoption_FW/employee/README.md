## Purpose

Boost your personal productivity with AI tools in 3 phases:
- **Prepare** (2h): Define objectives, select tools
- **Build** (4h): Secure setup, configure environment

| **[1. Prepare](01-prepare.md)** | Objectives + Tools + Skills | 2h | Use cases + Tool stack + Baseline assessment |
| **[2. Build](02-build.md)** | Security + Configuration | 4h | Hardened accounts + Backup plan |
| **[3. Run](03-run.md)** | Operations + Optimization | Ongoing | ROI tracking + Continuous improvement |

## Success Criteria (30 days)

- [ ] Save ≥2 hours/week with AI
- [ ] Use AI ≥3 times/week
- [ ] Zero security incidents
