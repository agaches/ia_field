# Phase 4: Govern - Individual AI Governance

## Overview

Respect usage policy and adopt personal best practices.

## 1. Individual Risks

| Risk | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Data Leak** | Accidental sharing of sensitive data |
| **Overreliance** | Blind trust in outputs |
| **IP Violation** | Using code/content without verification |

**Principle**: You are responsible for what you share and use.

## 2. Usage Rules

**✅ To Do**:
- Verify outputs before use
- MFA on all AI accounts
- Report incidents to IT

**❌ Forbidden**:
- Share sensitive data, credentials, PII
- Share confidential IP
- Bypass security controls

**Data Classification**:

| Type | Examples | AI Sharing |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Public | Public docs | ✅ OK |
| Internal | Emails, project docs | ⚠️ According to policy |
| Confidential | Contracts, financials | ❌ Forbidden |
| Secret | Credentials, keys | ❌ Never |

## 3. Incident Reporting

**If problem detected**:
1. Identify (data leak, problematic output, compromised account)
2. Open IT ticket (description, impact, actions taken)
3. Follow resolution with IT

## 4. Training

**AI Awareness (2h)**: AI concepts, OWASP LLM Top 10 risks, policy, security, reporting

**Resources**: [OWASP LLM Top 10](https://genai.owasp.org/), AI tools guides
