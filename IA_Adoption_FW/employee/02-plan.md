# Phase 2: Plan - Plan Your AI Learning

## Overview

Develop your basic AI skills and access the right tools.

## 1. Assess Your Skills (Level 1-2)

**Self-assessment**: Consult [SKILLS.md](../SKILLS.md) for:
- Understand Levels 1-2
- Self-assess your skills (Skills Matrix)
- Identify gaps

**Quick check - Are you Level 2?**
- ✅ Do you use 1+ SaaS tool regularly?
- ✅ Do you master prompt engineering (few-shot, CoT)?
- ✅ Have you integrated AI into your workflows?

→ **Yes to all 3**: Level 2, move to [Delivery Framework](../delivery/)
→ **No**: Level 1→2 training below

**Level 1 → 2 Training**: Consult [TRAINING.md](../TRAINING.md) section 3 for:
- Concepts: GenAI Fundamentals, Prompt Engineering, Business Practice
- Tools: ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, API basics
- Validation: 3 complex prompts + API call + quiz
- Resources and certifications

## 2. Access AI Tools

Create an account or request one from your company.

### Checklist

- [ ] Check company policies (authorized tools, shareable data)
- [ ] Create accounts (min 2 tools based on your needs)
- [ ] Configure security (2FA, opt-out training, never sensitive data)
- [ ] Test on non-critical tasks

## 3. Experiment

**Approach**:
1. Identify your painful, repetitive, and/or time-consuming tasks
2. Choose 1-2 non-critical tasks to start
3. Test the tool for 1 month on your real tasks
4. Measure: Time saved? Acceptable quality? Daily usage?
5. Decision: Adopt / Adjust / Abandon

## 4. Responsible AI - Basic Rules

**Data Protection**:
- ❌ Never: Passwords, customer data, proprietary code, financial info
- ✅ OK: Public code, public documentation, anonymized examples

**Output Verification**:
- Never blind copy-paste
- Always verify facts, references, syntax
- Test code before use

**AI Usage Transparency**:
- Mention AI usage for: code in PR, published content, evaluated work
- Optional for: emails, internal drafts

**Bias**:
- Remember: AI has biases and can be wrong (gender, culture, confirmation)
- Verify AI results or ask it to verify
- Vary prompts and tools, validate with external sources

## Plan Checklist

- [ ] Complete 2-4h training (AI fundamentals, prompt engineering)
- [ ] Create min 2 tool accounts, configure security
- [ ] Identify time-consuming tasks, choose 1-2 for experimentation
- [ ] Experiment for 1 month, measure results
- [ ] Decide: Adopt / Adjust / Abandon
- [ ] Iterate with other tools if needed
