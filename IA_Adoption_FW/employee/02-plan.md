# Phase 2: Plan - Plan Your AI Learning

## Assess AI skills

### Self-assessment framework

Consult [SKILLS.md](../SKILLS.md) for detailed maturity levels.

**Quick Level 1-2 check**:

**Level 1 (Beginner)**:
- Aware of AI tools but limited hands-on experience
- Can write basic prompts
- Uses AI occasionally for simple tasks

**Level 2 (Practitioner)**:
- Uses 1+ SaaS tool regularly
- Masters prompt engineering (few-shot, chain-of-thought)
- Has integrated AI into daily workflows

**Self-assessment**:
- ✅ Do you use AI tools regularly (3+ times/week)?
- ✅ Can you write effective prompts with context and examples?
- ✅ Have you integrated AI into your workflows?

→ **Yes to all 3**: Level 2, consider [Delivery Framework](../delivery/)
→ **No**: Continue with Level 1→2 training below

## Acquire AI skills

### Level 1 → 2 Training

Consult [TRAINING.md](../TRAINING.md) section 3 for complete training plan.

**Core concepts** (2-4 hours):
- Generative AI fundamentals
- Prompt engineering techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought)
- Business applications and use cases
- Limitations and risks

**Practical skills**:
- Master one conversational AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)
- For developers: code assistant (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Codeium)
- API basics for programmatic access (optional)

**Validation**:
- Create 3 complex prompts for your work tasks
- Make 1 successful API call (if applicable)
- Pass basic AI awareness quiz

## Access AI resources

### Account setup checklist

- [ ] Check company policy (authorized tools, data sharing rules)
- [ ] Create accounts on 2+ tools based on your use cases
- [ ] Configure security:
  - Enable 2FA/MFA on all accounts
  - Opt-out of data training if available
  - Review privacy settings
- [ ] Test tools on non-critical tasks first

### Tool access by type

**Free tier sufficient**:
- Gemini, ChatGPT free, Claude free
- Codeium (for developers)

**Paid recommended**:
- ChatGPT Plus or Claude Pro (for regular use)
- GitHub Copilot (for developers)

## Prioritize AI use cases

### Prioritization framework

Use this approach to select your first AI experiments:

**Criteria**:
1. **Time impact**: Tasks taking >30min that could be reduced
2. **Frequency**: Tasks you do 3+ times/week
3. **Low risk**: Non-critical tasks where errors are acceptable
4. **Clear success**: Easy to measure improvement

**Example prioritization**:

| Task | Time | Frequency | Risk | Priority |
|------|------|-----------|------|----------|
| Email drafting | 1h/day | Daily | Low | ⭐⭐⭐ High |
| Code documentation | 2h/week | Weekly | Low | ⭐⭐ Medium |
| Meeting notes | 30min/day | Daily | Low | ⭐⭐⭐ High |
| Architecture decisions | 4h/sprint | Rare | High | ⭐ Low |

**Select top 2-3 high-priority, low-risk tasks for initial experiments.**

## Create AI proof of concepts

### Experimentation approach

**Step 1: Choose experiment** (from prioritized list)
- Pick 1-2 non-critical tasks
- Set clear success criteria (time saved, quality, adoption)
- Timeline: 1 month experiment

**Step 2: Execute experiment**
- Use AI tool on real tasks daily
- Document what works and what doesn't
- Measure: time saved, quality, daily usage

**Step 3: Evaluate results**
- Did you save time? How much?
- Is quality acceptable?
- Are you using it daily?

**Step 4: Decision**
- **Adopt**: Integrate into permanent workflow
- **Adjust**: Change tool or approach, test again
- **Abandon**: Doesn't provide value, try different use case

### Success metrics

**Quantitative**:
- Time saved per week (target: 2+ hours)
- Usage frequency (target: 3+ times/week)
- Cost per hour saved (target: <$10/hour)

**Qualitative**:
- Improved work quality
- Reduced cognitive load
- Increased productivity satisfaction

## Implement responsible AI

### Data protection rules

**❌ Never share**:
- Passwords, API keys, credentials
- Customer data and PII
- Proprietary code and confidential IP
- Financial information

**✅ Safe to share**:
- Public code and documentation
- Anonymized examples
- General knowledge questions

### Output verification

- Never blind copy-paste AI output
- Always verify facts and references
- Test code before committing
- Review for bias and accuracy

### Transparency guidelines

**Mention AI usage for**:
- Code in pull requests
- Published content
- Work being evaluated

**Optional disclosure for**:
- Internal emails and drafts
- Personal productivity tasks

### Bias awareness

- AI reflects training data biases (gender, culture, etc.)
- Vary prompts and tools for important decisions
- Validate results with external sources
- Ask AI to challenge its own outputs

## Plan Checklist

- [ ] Complete self-assessment (Level 1 or 2?)
- [ ] Complete 2-4h training (AI fundamentals, prompt engineering)
- [ ] Create accounts on 2+ tools with security configured
- [ ] Prioritize 2-3 use cases for experimentation
- [ ] Run 1-month experiment on selected use cases
- [ ] Measure results and decide: Adopt/Adjust/Abandon
