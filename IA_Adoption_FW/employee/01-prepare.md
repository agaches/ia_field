# Phase 1: Prepare

> **Goal**: Define objectives, select tools, assess readiness
> **Time**: 2 hours
> **Output**: Use cases + Tool stack + Baseline assessment

---

## 1. Identify Your Use Cases

**Question**: *If you had an AI assistant for 2 hours/day, what tasks would you delegate first?*

Identify 3 priority tasks where AI saves you time this week.

📋 **Tool**: [Use Case Identification Matrix](../templates/employee/use-case-identification-matrix.md)
**Common categories**:
- **Writing**: Emails, docs, summaries → Fast drafting
- **Code**: Debugging, tests, refactoring → Higher velocity
- **Analysis**: Data sorting, research → Better insights
- **Creative**: Brainstorming, mockups → More ideas

---

## 2. Select Your Tool Stack

**Budget**: $20-50/month (start small, expand if ROI proven)

**Recommended approach**: 1 conversational tool + 1 specialized tool

📋 **Tool**: [Tool Selection Matrix](../templates/employee/tool-selection-matrix.md)
**Quick reference**:

| Type | Examples | Cost | Best For |
|------|----------|------|----------|
| **Conversational** | ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro | $20/mo | Writing, brainstorming, analysis |
| **Code Assistant** | GitHub Copilot, Cursor | $10-20/mo | Development, debugging |
| **Search** | Perplexity, NotebookLM | $0-20/mo | Research, fact-checking |

**Action**: Choose 1 primary tool + 1 backup tool for your first month.

## 3. Understand Data Classification

**Before pasting anything into an AI tool, memorize these rules:**

📋 **Reference**: [Data Classification Guide](../templates/shared/data-classification-guide.md)
**Quick rules**:
- 🟢 **SAFE**: Public docs, open-source code, general knowledge
- 🟡 **CAUTION**: Internal project names, meeting notes (anonymize first)
- 🔴 **FORBIDDEN**: Passwords, API keys, customer PII, financials, proprietary code

**One rule to remember**: *When in doubt, don't share it.*

## 4. Assess Your Skills

**Current maturity level**:
- **Level 1 (Basic)**: I know AI exists, I use it occasionally
- **Level 2 (Intermediate)**: I use it daily, I know prompt engineering basics

📋 **Complete assessment**: [SKILLS.md](../SKILLS.md) - Full 7-domain maturity grid

**Plan**: If Level 1, block 2 hours for "Prompt Engineering 101" before proceeding.

📋 **Training resources**: [TRAINING.md](../TRAINING.md) - Level 1→2 path

## 5. Define Success Metrics

**How will you measure success in 30 days?**

### Required Metrics
- [ ] Time saved: ≥2 hours/week
- [ ] Usage frequency: ≥3 times/week
- [ ] Security incidents: 0
- [ ] ROI: ≥3x subscription cost

### Optional Metrics
- [ ] New skills: 3 prompt techniques learned
- [ ] Quality: Improved output quality (self-rated)

## Phase 1 Checklist

Complete before moving to Phase 2:

- [ ] 3 clear use cases identified
- [ ] 2 tools selected (1 primary, 1 backup)
- [ ] Data "red line" rules understood
- [ ] Current skill level assessed (Level 1 or 2)
- [ ] Success metrics defined
- [ ] 2h learning block scheduled (if Level 1)

**Estimated time**: 2 hours total
