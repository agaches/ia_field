# Cloud-Agnostic AI Adoption Framework

> Lightweight AI adoption framework, cloud vendor agnostic, based on Cloud Adoption Framework best practices.

> This framework provides guidance, not prescriptive details. Users are expected to research specific topics based on their context.

## Purpose

Structured AI adoption following the "Person → Team → Product" model: individual skills, team processes, business production.

## 3 AI Adoption Frameworks

| Framework | For Whom? | Maturity | Start Here |
|-----------|-----------|----------|------------|
| **[Employee](employee/)** | Individuals | Levels 1-2 | Personal productivity |
| **[Delivery](delivery/)** | Teams | Levels 2-3 | Team processes |
| **[Automation](automation/)** | Organizations | Levels 3-4 | Production apps |

**Progression**: Employee → Delivery → Automation (don't skip steps)

## Which Framework to Use?

- **Personal productivity** (work assistant, coding assistant) → [Employee](employee/)
- **Team processes** (code review, testing) → [Delivery](delivery/)
- **Production apps** (chatbot, API, AI workflows) → [Automation](automation/)

> Never used AI? → Start with [Employee](employee/)

## Getting Started

1. **Assess your level**: [SKILLS.md](SKILLS.md) - Self-assessment matrix (4 maturity levels)
2. **Choose your framework**: Based on maturity and scope (see table above)
3. **Follow the 6 phases**: Strategy → Plan → Ready → Govern → Secure → Manage

**Next step**: Read [STRATEGY.md](STRATEGY.md) to understand the complete model

## Resources

- **Training**: [TRAINING.md](TRAINING.md) - Progression paths by level (1→2, 2→3, 3→4)
- **Glossary**: [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md) - Cloud service equivalences (AWS/GCP/Azure)
