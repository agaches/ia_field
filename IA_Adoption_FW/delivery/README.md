# Delivery AI Framework

> Team AI integration for collective development processes

## Purpose

This framework is for **technical teams and leads** who want to integrate AI into delivery processes:
- AI-automated code review
- Collective documentation generation
- AI-assisted testing and refactoring
- Sprint planning with AI support

**Target audience**: Development teams looking to improve velocity and quality with AI

**Maturity level**: Levels 2-3 (intermediate to advanced) - See [SKILLS.md](../SKILLS.md)

## Prerequisites

Before using this framework, ensure:
- ✅ **Individual maturity**: Team members are proficient with AI tools ([Employee Framework](../employee/README.md) Levels 1-2)
- ✅ **Team readiness**: 50%+ team uses AI daily
- ✅ **AI champion**: At least one team member ready to lead AI adoption

**Not ready yet?** Start with the [Employee Framework](../employee/README.md) to build individual skills first.

## 6-Phase Framework

| Phase | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| [Strategy](01-strategy.md) | Explore team integration patterns |
| [Plan](02-plan.md) | Plan collective experimentation |
| [Ready](03-ready.md) | Prepare team infrastructure |
| [Govern](04-govern.md) | Establish team policies |
| [Secure](05-secure.md) | Implement security controls |
| [Manage](06-manage.md) | Monitor and optimize operations |

## Next Steps

Once your team has 6-12 months of Delivery experience (Levels 2-3), progress to the **[Automation Framework](../automation/README.md)** to deploy AI applications in production.
