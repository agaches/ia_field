# Delivery Framework - Team AI Integration

> **Target**: Development teams and technical leads
> **Maturity**: Levels 2-3 (Intermediate → Advanced)
> **Timeline**: 4-8 weeks to operational
> **Budget**: Few k$/month per team

## Purpose

Integrate AI into collective delivery processes in 3 phases:
- **Prepare** (1-2 weeks): Team assessment, use case selection, experimentation plan
- **Build** (2-3 weeks): Infrastructure setup, team policies, security controls
- **Run** (ongoing): Collective operations, velocity tracking, continuous improvement

## Prerequisites

Before using this framework, ensure:
- ✅ **Individual maturity**: Team members proficient with AI (Employee Levels 1-2)
- ✅ **Team readiness**: ≥50% team uses AI daily
- ✅ **AI champion**: At least 1 team member ready to lead adoption
- ✅ **Management support**: Budget and time allocated

**Not ready yet?** Start with [Employee Framework](../employee/) to build individual skills first.

## 3-Phase Journey

| Phase | Focus | Time | Deliverable |
|-------|-------|------|-------------|
| **[1. Prepare](01-prepare.md)** | Assessment + Use Cases + Plan | 1-2 weeks | Team readiness + Integration roadmap |
| **[2. Build](02-build.md)** | Infrastructure + Policies + Security | 2-3 weeks | Team environment + Data governance |
| **[3. Run](03-run.md)** | Operations + Optimization + Scale | Ongoing | Velocity gains + Knowledge sharing |

## Success Criteria (90 days)

- [ ] ≥3 team processes AI-augmented
- [ ] Velocity increase ≥15% (measured)
- [ ] All team members using AI weekly
- [ ] Zero security incidents
- [ ] ROI ≥5x team investment
- [ ] Documented best practices shared

## Team AI Integration Patterns

**Code-focused teams**:
- AI-assisted code review
- Test generation automation
- Documentation generation
- Refactoring support

**Product teams**:
- Sprint planning assistance
- User story refinement
- Technical spike research
- Architecture exploration

**DevOps teams**:
- Incident analysis
- Runbook generation
- Infrastructure as Code generation
- Log analysis and troubleshooting

## Next Steps

Once your team has 6-12 months of Delivery experience (Levels 2-3), progress to **[Automation Framework](../automation/)** for production AI systems.
